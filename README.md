# ElderScrollsOfAlts
Addon/mod for Elder Scrolls Online - to keep general track of alts

Currently with a moderately looking UI, basic sorting, and at least some of the details I want to store/show.
This addon only knows about characters it has been loaded with
It will probably not hook into changes in realtime, and just update on start, Gui showing and hopefully shutdown.
All things/buttons etc may not work, but I hope to not have errors
